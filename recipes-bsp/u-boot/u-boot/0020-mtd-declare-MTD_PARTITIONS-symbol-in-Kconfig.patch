Subject: [PATCH] mtd: declare MTD_PARTITIONS symbol in Kconfig

UBI selects MTD_PARTITIONS which is the symbol to compile
drivers/mtd/mtdpart.c. Unfortunately, the symbol was not defined in
Kconfig and this worked only with board files defining it. Fix this by
adding a boolean in Kconfig so boards defined by defconfig files only
will work as expected.
