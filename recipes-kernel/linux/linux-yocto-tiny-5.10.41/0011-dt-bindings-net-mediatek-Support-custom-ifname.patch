Subject: [PATCH] dt-bindings: net: mediatek: Support custom ifname

The (optional) label property allows to specify customized interfaces
names.

The motivation behind this change is to allow embedded devices to keep
their first switch port be named "eth0", even when switching to the DSA
architecture. In order to do so, it must be possible to name the MAC
interface differently from eth0.
